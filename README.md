# ros2-tb4
Docker and Dev Container build for ROS2 Jazzy Jalisco with TurtleBot4 components.

It also contains a more [recent version](https://launchpad.net/~kisak/+archive/ubuntu/turtle/) of 
[Mesa](https://mesa3d.org/), with better support for OpenGL on D3D12, suitable for using this image on WSL2.
